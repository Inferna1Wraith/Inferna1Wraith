- Hi, I’m Christopher Donald Seymour...
- I’m interested in Fullstack Development, however leaning more towards Backend.
- I’m currently learning courses in JS, Python and C++, and on the side are very fimiliar with Delphi. I have had less experience in other
- languages such as Java and C#.
- I have been practicing code and development for the past 7 years, unfortunately due to financial constrainsts, I was not able to finish my degree.
- I have always loved development, I have found many ways in getting more knowledge within the developer field and improving my skills 
- and thinking in order to complete personal projects with ease.
- I’m looking to collaborate on new projects, personal projects and looking for a foot in the door after 7 years of wanting to do my profession.
- You can reach me via my email cdseymour6@gmail.com.
- In the future I see myself wanting to learn more and more until I have acheived my goals and I do not see myself stopping in this field.

-I look forward to hearing from you.
-I am open to any further questions anyone has for me and will be happy to reach back out.

-Sincerely

-Christopher Seymour
